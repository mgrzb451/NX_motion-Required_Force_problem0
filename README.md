# NX Motion Simulation - Determine Force Required - Test Problem
I didn't fully understand how Static Analysis and Inverse Dynamic Analysis solution types could be used to determine requisite Force or Moment for a given scenario, so before jumping into a more complex problem I did a small test of my own device

# Result from Simulation
Nothing more satisfying than seeing the same number here 🥰

Onto a real problem!
